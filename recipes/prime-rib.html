  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    After years of experimenting with different cooking methods for a standing rib roast, I've finally perfected the Christmas dinner. Dry-brining the prime rib the day before roasting means every bite is flavorful, and slow-roasting at a low temperature followed by a high-heat sear ensures a delicious medium-rare doneness throughout with a savory herb crust.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (10 pound) bone-in standing rib roast</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>Â½ cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Season roast generously with kosher salt. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Remove roast from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Mix butter, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper together in a small bowl; spread butter mixture over roast. Place roast in a large roasting pan.</li>
    <li>Bake roast in the preheated oven until internal temperature reaches 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) for medium-rare, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and tent with aluminum foil; allow to rest, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Uncover roast.</li>
    <li>Return roast to the oven and bake until well-browned, 6 to 10 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>
  </ol>
