odin-recipes

This is the first project from the Odin Project carriculum that students are asked to work on.
The purpose of this project is to put into practice the very basics of HTML5 as taught in the program.

Tags like h1, p, a, img etc., and attributes like href, src, alt, will be used. Absolute and relative links will be used.

Overall, through this project we will practice how to structure a web page (or website) using HTML5.
