The purpose of this project is to put into practice some very basics of HTML5.

Tags like h1, p, a, img etc., and attributes like href, src, alt, are used. Absolute and relative links are used as well.

Overall, through this project I practiced how to structure a web page (or website) using HTML5.

UPDATE:
I added some CSS styles to this website. 

The styles will be in a separate file and linked to the HTML pages that were created in the beginning of the project.
